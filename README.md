## Coming Soon

### Self-Correcting Code Agent
In the upcoming update, I am implementing a self-correcting code agent. This feature will allow the agent to self-execute and evaluate the code before presenting it to the user, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability.

### Streamlit Frontend Updates
I am also planning to update the Streamlit frontend to improve user experience and add new interactive features.
